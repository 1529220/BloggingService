1) Unit test: both validation rules are tested and passing

I tested the methods usign a Graphic User Interface. 
This not only helps to create a better user experience, 
but also permits me to constantly check the functionaly of my code in a quick and efficient way.

The rules tested are related to the validation check of the messages entered.

The program should show a useful error to the user if:
-The message is empty 
-The message is more than 150 characters


Firstly I checked that the message isn't longer that 150 characters. If it is the I display an unsuccessful message.
	

			 	 if(newmessage.length()>150){
                 		        errorMessage("Message too long" , "error");
				 }


Then I chekc that the message isn't empty.If it is the I display an unsuccessful message.


				 else if(newmessage.length()==0){
					 errorMessage("Message too short" , "error");
				 }

				  else{ 
					 Delete = new JButton("Delete");
					 Delete.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
					 public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent arg0) {
								
							}
						});


If th emessage is correctly entered I display a successful message.


					 errorMessage("Message entered correctly" , "Success");
					 
					 for(int k = 0;k<newmessage.length();k++){
						 if(newmessage.charAt(k)=='\n'){
						 newmessage.replaceAll("\n", " ");
						 System.out.print(newmessage);
						 }
					 }
